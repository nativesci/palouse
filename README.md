Biodiversity and Culturally Significant Plants of the Palouse Prairie
Includes dataset and various R code developed by Dr. Cleve Davis as part of PhD dissertation research at the University of Idaho. Desription of the dataset is as follows:
Plant species cover, including biological soil crusts, were estimated following Daubenmireâ€™s (1959) canopy-coverage method. Sample units were 0.50 by 0.25 m rectangular quadrats and transect direction was obtained randomly using a random number generator. The long axis of the quadrat frame was oriented away from the transect line. Within in each quadrat, foliar percent cover of species was documented in classes on the following scale: 0, 1 = 0.01-5%, 2 = 5-12.5%, 3 = 12.5-25%, 4 = 25-50%, 5 = 50-75%, 6 = 75-100%. 
Plant species data were collected in May-July during 2012 and 2013 when a majority of plant species could be easily identified. Transect orientation of all plots was chosen randomly. Species were identified in the field or collected and identified by comparison with herbarium specimens at the University of Idaho Stillinger and Washington State University Marion Ownbey herbaria. Overall, a total of 104 plots were sampled or 1,248 quadrat frames were read to determine cover by species.
